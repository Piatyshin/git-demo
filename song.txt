sword and spear
wall of shields
standing strong
on this their chosen battle field

form the lines
shield by shield
side by side 
we're marching into destiny

It's your day, believe it
It's your date with destiny
It's too late to leave it
After all it's your, it's your party
Call it luck, call it fate
Call me beautiful to my face
Call it off, to my surprise
It's just how you made it
Out of my way, I'm running
I'm gonna catch you if I can
Out of my way, I'm coming
I'm gonna catch you if I can
Out of my way, I'm running
I'm gonna catch you if I can
Out of my way, start running
I'm gonna catch you
